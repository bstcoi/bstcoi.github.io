The Buddhist Sin Tak College Competitive Programming Team was launched in 2024. The team will organize an annual inter-school programming competition (Buddhist Sin Tak College Computer Club Programming Contest; STPC) and offer training sessions to members. All members after training can participate in external competitive programming competitions, such as the HKOI (Hong Kong Olympiad in Informatics) and SDIC (Hong Kong Secondary Schools Software Development Invitational Contest).
